I have a project that is a audio e video player for beaglebone black.
 But I´m just a beginner.

Instructions:

Create 2 folders for mass storage mounting
My program will look for /mnt/pd and /mnt/pd2/ folders

I´m struggling to develop a algoritm that will search and
play the files even from subdirectories
