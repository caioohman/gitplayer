I have a project that is a audio e video player for beaglebone black.
 But I´m just a beginner.

Instructions:

bbb -> ubuntu 13.04
install mplayer 
install alsa-base
install mediainfo

Create 2 folders for mass storage mounting
My program will look for /mnt/pd and /mnt/pd2/ folders

clone the repo into /home/ubuntu/ folder

add the line :
bash /home/ubuntu/gitplayer/startup.bash
to /etc/rc.local file before exit 0.(the program will start from boot)

set the frequency of the bbb to 1GHz from boot
latter I´ll teach how to do it.



Goal:

I´m struggling to develop a algoritm that will search and
play the files even from subdirectories
