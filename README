I have a project that is a audio e video player for beaglebone black.
 But I´m just a beginner.

Instructions:

bbb -> ubuntu 13.04
install mplayer 
install alsa-base
install mediainfo

-Create 2 folders for mass storage mounting
My program will look for /mnt/pd and /mnt/pd2/ folders

-clone the repo into /home/ubuntu/ folder

-rc.local file located int the '/etc/' folder (it´s really necessary to add) :

sleep 15

python /home/ubuntu/gitplayer/ip_print.py

#time to connect
sleep 120

if [ `ps aux |grep ssh |wc -l` -eq 3 ]
then

clear > /dev/tty1
#once on a ssh terminal you need to type the command below
#and wait until leave the msg to execute.Otherwise the program will crash
echo 'Voce precisa digitar o comando ' > /dev/tty1
echo 'bash /home/ubuntu/gitplayer/startup.bash ' > /dev/tty1
echo 'e executa-lo com a tecla enter depois que sair esse aviso' > /dev/tty1

else
bash /home/ubuntu/gitplayer/startup.bash
fi

exit 0


-set the frequency of the bbb to 1GHz from boot:

[your favorite text editor] /etc/init.d/cpufrequtil

change GOVERNOR to performance 
change MAX_SPEED to 1000000
change MIN_SPEED to 1000000

Goal:

I´m struggling to develop a algoritm that will search and
play the files even from subdirectories

Improve algorithm
