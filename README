I have a project that is a audio e video player for beaglebone black.
 But I´m just a beginner.

Instructions:

bbb -> ubuntu 13.04
install mplayer 
install alsa-base
install mediainfo

-Create 2 folders for mass storage mounting
My program will look for /mnt/pd and /mnt/pd2/ folders

-clone the repo into /home/ubuntu/ folder

-rc.local file located int the '/etc/' folder (it´s really necessary to add) :

#!/bin/bash

/home/ubuntu/gitplayer/valid.bash
exit 0


-set the frequency of the bbb to 1GHz from boot:

[your favorite text editor] /etc/init.d/cpufrequtils

change GOVERNOR to performance 
change MAX_SPEED to 1000000
change MIN_SPEED to 1000000

Goal:

I´m struggling to develop a algoritm that will search and
play the files even from subdirectories

Improve algorithm
