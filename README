I have a project that is a audio e video player for beaglebone black.
 But I´m just a beginner.

Instructions:

bbb -> ubuntu 13.04
install mplayer 
install alsa-base

Create 2 folders for mass storage mounting
My program will look for /mnt/pd and /mnt/pd2/ folders

I put all file into /home/ubuntu/bin/ folder and I called then
in startup.bash file so if you change the folder, change the code

set the frequency of the bbb to 1GHz from boot
latter I´ll teach how to do it.

Include the line before the line exit 0
bash /home/ubuntu/bin/startup.bash
At /etc/rc.local file to run the program from boot

Plug the HDMI cable and check if is tty1

Goal:

I´m struggling to develop a algoritm that will search and
play the files even from subdirectories

Testing mplayer options for video´s file
